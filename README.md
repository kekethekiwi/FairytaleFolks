# FairytaleFolks

**Project Description: **
Schuyler Burke and Kelly Zhang created an immersive, interactive recreation of Mulan and the Matchmaker scene.

Kelly forefronted coding in the Arduino Language and confirming that mechanisms worked, while
also assisting Schuyler with design decisions and conveying affordances. 
Schuyler forefronted the design of the hardware and digitally painted all assets, while giving code suggestions
to help resolve playtesting issues.
